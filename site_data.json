            "review":"While on a trip to Wroclaw, we found this place because we were captivated by the plants. The entrance fee was 10 PLN per adult. In the park there are beautiful ponds where lilies grow, there are also bridges in the Japanese style. In the Japanese garden there are many different plants such as bonsai trees. There is also a small waterfall in the park. Japanese garden is not big, but it is surrounded by a huge park, which I also recommend to see. At the end of the tour of the Japanese garden I recommend to go to the Centennial Hall for a fountain show. The whole place has its own wonderful charm that we really recommend to see everyone who wants to relax and unwind.",
