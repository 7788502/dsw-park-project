            "review":"This park is really cool, due the fact, that we visited it spontaniously. It's a small peace of Japan in Wroclaw. This park is small, but really comfortable. The entrance here for student costs 5 zloty. This park is really chill, and flowers there right now are in full bloom, colorful and decorative. I definitely recommend to enter before 12 at the weekend, less queue :)  ",

It's a great place for walking with sticks, running, because you can calm down and feel like in the forest for a while. :) The minus is the lack of lighting lamps and the bridge, in front of which there has been a notice of renovation for over a year - so far nothing has changed in this matter.",

On the plus side there are aesthetic footbridges and the fact that the park is being expanded, new trees were planted. Even the proximity of railroad tracks adds charm and individuality to this place. In the middle of the park maze as an attraction for children and not only. On the negative side muddy paths, no gravel, no paving, and no direct parking.",
